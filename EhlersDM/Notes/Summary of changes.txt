Error Reporting changes

Current Error Reporting process:

All Error Reporting is accomplished with a two step-process:
    1)  TRY..CATCH blocks surrounding SQL Statements
    2)  CATCH block invokes proc dbo.processEhlersError
    
    processEhlersError determines whether error is a business rules error or a SQL Server error, formats the output, and
        creates an email message describing the error.
        
        For SQL Server errors, processEhlersError will write a log record of the error.
        

Current process treats everything as an error, and the formatting is not ideal.
